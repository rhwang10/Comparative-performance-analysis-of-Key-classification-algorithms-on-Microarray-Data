Algorithms.py

In this file, we run each classifier on each data set. There are 3 functions
, each runs a classifier on the passed in data set. Eaach function prints
out the evaluation metrics including a confusion matrix. The breast cancer
data file opened is in the /scratch/msong2 directory; however, the one submitted
is in the /home/msong2/cs68/Project-rhwang1-msong2/code/data directory. These
are the exact two files. 

Parse.py

This file contains all the functions for parsing. Each function parses a
particular data set. For example, the parse_mosquitoData function will
specifically parse the mosquito.csv file.
